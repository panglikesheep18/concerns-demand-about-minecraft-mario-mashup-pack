Related videos for sake ðŸ’€ðŸ’€ (why i forgot these), but please do not attempt what he said as piracy is illegal and can get you arrested for such.
These related videos below are why Louis Rossmann chose or think of piracy as a result in my bias, and my bias of when my logic were applied.

# **Please note these videos below have slurs that might be offensive to people. also please do not attempt piracy if you could buy such to own.**

[Piracy is COMPLETELY justified: Louis tries NetFlix & remembers why](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4GZUCwVRLs) (TL;DR in my bias, Paying for one gives worse experience than pirating the same), For me, it's if i paid for Minecraft for Nintendo Switch with Super Mario Mash-up Pack, i cannot play the mash-up pack on my devices because it is a preload and is not on Minecraft Marketplace servers (not searchable on Minecraft Marketplace Catalog) in the first place, so it cannot be saved to my Marketplace library despite it's claimed to be part of "Minecraft Marketplace content", and i can't even enable cross-platform multiplayer on my Nintendo Switch for PC and mobile players to join in, but if i had downloaded the Super Mario Mash-up Pack from the internet, i could use it on my devices and even host cross-platform multiplayer.
In another words, when i paid for and used that on Nintendo Switch, i get punished for just using the skins from Super Mario Mash-up Pack by disallowing use in cross-platform multiplayer, but if i downloaded one from the internet and done some patching / working for my devices to work, i get rewarded by allowing me to host the world from Super Mario Mash-up Pack, on LAN multiplayer, while using the skin from the mash-up pack.

[Sony & Discovery change mind on stealing from customers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bpzyz5kf_A) (TL;DR in my bias, although the license period between 2 companies were extended by 30 months, Sony have used the word "purchase" wrong on purpose, with their meaning not easy to be found (the rules are put to their EULA in a way it cannot be found without having an eagle eye / proper research)), For me it's like because the game said "Includes Super Mario Mash-up Pack" without the disclaimer or even the star telling me what the star meant, so i have never find out skins from Super Mario Mash-up Pack was platform restricted until i tried to equip one while on cross-platform multiplayer and failing, and when i was searching for one, in "Different Minecraft Versions" on Minecraft Help, it claimed that the Super Mario Mash-up Pack was included on Minecraft for Nintendo Switch, but was "only usable by Nintendo Switch players" **after** i bought the game. To add insult to injury, i had to contact Minecraft Support for why it was platform restricted, at this time it's **still after the purchase** of the game. ~~However, there are freeloaders who treat sellers bad but if respectful customers were also treated as if they were freeloaders, should they then be disrespectful.~~
