# My information about Platform Restriction (hardest call-out question, Companies got angry at me talking about such)

## What restrictions did Mojang put so it tells the game that the content is platform / multiplayer restricted?
- `"platform_locked": true` (source: https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/70vu0u/how_the_super_mario_pack_will_be_restricted_in/) and `"pack_scope": "world"` (source: https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-160631)
- For `"platform_locked"`, when it's set to true, on the resource pack, behavior pack or skin-pack, and you use one of them, Minecraft will forcefully disable multiplayer or cross-platform multiplayer depending which platform you use. However when it's set to false, nothing happens, as if you're using a regular content.
- wheres `"pack_scope"` is used to limit where the resource pack can be used in, if it's set to `"global"`, the pack will be restricted to only be used as global resource and `"world"` will restrict it to only be used in the world. it's stupid that it's "Working as Intended" when it is set-up as an anti-feature for customization on-device only! (source: https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-160631) update: some UI on the menu are not changed.
- Mojang / Nintendo could've updated the license, removed restrictions, updated it's thumbnail to have the license shown up, and have it put to Minecraft Marketplace, **it's ## easy, it only takes 3 weeks maximum**

## What other contents were affected by platform restriction DRM and what is it?
 - carries over XBOX versions of Minecraft, with multiplayer disabled in Bedrock counterpart due to the licensing issue (with Marvel and / or Disney):
   - Marvel Avengers Skin Pack
   - Marvel Spider-Man Skin Pack
   - Marvel Guardians of the Galaxy Skin Pack
 - carries over XBOX versions of Minecraft, with multiplayer disabled in Bedrock counterpart due to the licensing issue (with Fox Broadcasting Company and / or Disney):
   - Simpsons Skin Pack
     
 - However there are no mentions of Super Mario Mash-up Pack being platform-restricted due to licensing issues in the source.
 - source: https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/better-together-faq

 - Also there are no mentions of LittleBigPlanet Mash-up Pack being platform-restricted.  
 - ...And contents you want to restrict if you want to be evil.
  
 - It uses the flag i listed above to prevent players from using it in multiplayer, which so it is to "avoid potential licensing issues", however these contents are straight-up ported to other versions of the game (from Console Edition to Bedrock for console) so i think it's ironic to say it was "licensing issue" when you ported the contents from one to another, even though they serve the same purpose.
