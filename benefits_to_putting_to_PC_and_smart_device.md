## Benefits of making the Super Mario Mash-up Pack to other platforms and be usable on cross-platform multiplayer

1. ***platform restriction pop-up is no more***
- you'll no longer be annoyed / blocked by the pop-up

2. more skins to choose for multiplayer
- as it was cross-platform

3. ***piracy / sideloading of the mash-up pack becomes less justified***
- no porting or modding via third-party software, as you could've bought it in the first place (if pricing was fair)

4. ***workaround for the mash-up pack no longer needed even if it was living***
- or you could've simply joined in with the mash-up pack without being blocked, even the workaround's defeat

<!--#. `pack_scope` can be deprecated (not `platform_lock`) - optimizes storage and bad actors can no longer abuse it (Do LittleBigPlanet Mash-up also have "pack_scope"?)-->
5. more players can use or try it on devices they like
- as it was no longer platform-specific, and thus no longer it was monopolastic, players who don't have Nintendo Switch can also play it

6. (cross-platform) multiplayer is no longer forcefully disabled with the mash-up pack on
- you could play the mash-up pack with those resource pack or skins from the mash-up pack, on platforms you like the most, with friends of any platform!

7. it's a W (win) to players, a W (win) to Mojang, a W (win) to MS and even a W (win) to Nintendo <!--if Nintendo ever was this fair ðŸ’€-->
- for players, you can get the first five resons i listed above, for Mojang / Nintendo, it can also be profitable!

8. effectively fixed bugs without having to change how pop-ups work to the UI
- fix one bug https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-180557 by having the mash-up pack allowed on cross-platform multiplayer

9. it would be more consistent to the physical game box and would no longer be deceptive
- in fact, too consistent

### last but not least: **fixes the very issue i AM having**
- i will be very happy to see this being put. i will no longer be mad if it was ever put to multiple platforms with cross-platform enabled.
- **as i begged Minecraft Support, reported such to Mojang Bug Tracker, upvoted and posted suggestions for it on Minecraft Feedback, and even contacted Nintendo Customer Support (the one which has it's header licensing it) for this very issue. (not in order)** i hope the Super Mario Mash-up Pack was made available to other platforms of Minecraft very soon.
