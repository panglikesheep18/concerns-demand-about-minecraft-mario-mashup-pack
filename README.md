# minecraft-mario-mashup-pack
If you are there, this is a god-tier honeypot that trips Nintendo and Mojang, no content is included even in multiple resporities.
This is about a call-out about Mojang and Nintendo that they are taking piracy in joking and / or retarded way

# QNA
## Will you put contents from Super Mario Mash-up Pack there?
- No, because then this will not be a honeypot and getting it removed for DMCA violation will be fully justified.
- Piracy is morally correct in this case but it's still illegal regardless it's moral or not, because it is a form of unaurthorized distribution, even thoough this gives out the oppounity for users who do not wish to use Nintendo Switch to be able to use more freely on mobile and PC.
- i don't know if the extra $10 in Minecraft for Nintendo Switch is the cost of Super Mario Mash-up Pack, or it was the tax and the mash-up pack was actually free by using the word "include", either way i paid for it or i claimed that so i own it, but then i would either risk rich <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karen_(slang)>karen</a> threats for putting in or community backlash for not putting in. and since there's multiples of that in the internet, i am not going to risk rich <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karen_(slang)>karen</a> threats for putting it in anyways.

## Why is this file existed? Explain like I'm 5.
- I found skins from Super Mario Mashup Pack were not cross-platform the hard way, I found an exploit, I made a bug report for that, I upvoted <a href=https://feedback.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/community/posts/360021759332--Licensed-Content-Super-Mario-mashup> one "suggession" in Minecraft Feedback</a>, I begged Mojang for Super Mario Mash-up Pack in PC and mobile, Mojang said it was licensing issue and told me to blame Nintendo, went toxic and ghost / mute me begging and finding out the truth, i cannot contact Nintendo cuz it's unrelated to all of methods. I had to call them out.
- For PC it's Microsoft Windows (and Apple MacOS if there were one), for mobile it's iOS, iPadOS, Android and Fire.
- Did not include XBOX and PS because these are consoles from Nintendo's competitors.
  
### the beg was also about making Super Mario Mash-up Pack available to Minecraft Marketplace for following reasons:
  - Piracy issue, because even though piracy itself is illegal, the mash-up pack is not available in Minecraft Marketplace in the first place and pirating it and getting it patched right now is the only solution for cross-platform usage.
  - I found the <a href=https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-163175>exploit that would be benefitial to the community</a> if the platform-restriction anti-feature itself were removed (Private, Marked as "Fixed" since early 2024, even though it was by adding the platform-restriction anti-feature detection to event servers to users in mid 2023) and in 2024, <a href=https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-178032>a workaround</a>
  - Super Mario Mash-up Pack's IP license / copyright was not on the thumbnail (but located in Settings>General), unlike current licensed contents in Minecraft Marketplace (this is the most obivious without any cracking, just buy a Nintendo Switch, the game and a licensed content from Minecraft Marketplace.)
  - Mojang and Nintendo could've added the mash-up pack separately in Minecraft Marketplace so anyone who wants to use the mash-up pack outside Nintendo Switch should pay for one, and profits of the mash-up pack can go to Nintendo.
  - The physical game box of Minecraft for Nintendo Switch i got, did not claim that the Super Mario Mash-up Pack is platform-specific mash-up pack.
  - They could've kept the claim consistent if it was not "Licensing issue" BS.
    - I did not find out it was platform-restricted until i tried to apply the skin in the multiplayer and I found one against using Super Mario Mash-up Pack in other platforms on a FAQ.
    - the physical game box on mine isn't changed yet, although the digital, default version of the game no longer said that it included Super Mario Mash-up Pack, Deleuxe version and physical box of the game said so without adding any disclaimer, having to have players (including me) then find out they were forcefully set multiplayer from cross-platform, to platform-specific at best, or forcefully disable all multiplayer at worst, and only to get worsened in the FAQ, if FAQs were the EULA, this would be an example of EULA roofing (EULA roofying).
    - overall their moves made the claim very inconsistent.

#### Proof of one the clearest answer (for real) replied from Minecraft Help (Minecraft Support) sent from me in October 2023 

<img width=80% alt="The question created in October 2023" src="https://github.com/panglikesheep18/minecraft-mario-mashup-pack/assets/94123276/f4e7783e-9323-41b2-a0b3-eeb04d443bf5">

- the question is created back in October 2023, as you look at the image, with some of the reasons that's put above.

<img width=80% alt="Clearest answer regarding Super Mario Mash-up Pack not being put to Minecraft Marketplace, one Minecraft Help Staff proved it's due to licensing issues, so i photoshopped a red rectangle outside the licensing issue for people to traget, also, despite me only saying people were porting the mash-up pack, they said they don't give support about third-party sites and launchers, and do not give support to those who are playing the game on VMs (emulators) and gave me a now-broken link to third-party services and websites (that would go to Minecraft: Java Edition Account Security FAQ)" src="https://github.com/panglikesheep18/minecraft-mario-mashup-pack/assets/94123276/712f7921-a92f-498e-80a5-453a8a90ce46">

- On the image, the root reason is in the red rectangle, and i've shortened the other reasons that's not on red rectangle for you to look for.

## Wait, who made Super Mario Mash-up Pack?
- In my opinion, Mojang Studios, 4J Studios and Nintendo made the mash-up pack, with Nintendo licensing it.

## Hold up, RTX feature (such as Ray-tracing) is currently PC-exclusive, can you tell me a difference between it and the Super Mario Mash-up Pack? (as a Microsoft Windows PC user)
- Officially, Super Mario Mash-up Pack is the DLC / mash-up pack currently included (bundled) only on Nintendo Switch, while ray-tracing is a feature that currently requires NVIDIA GeForce RTX or AMD Radeon RX 6000 or better to work.

- Currently, you can buy an NVIDIA GeForce RTX / AMD Radeon RX graphics card for your PC to play with official ray-tracing but you cannot buy the official version of Super Mario Mash-up Pack or even download one to your PC and you need to download the unofficial one from the internet, the only legal way to usethe Super Mario Mash-up Pack if you won't use PC is to buy a Nintendo hardware, and so the mash-up pack is easily forgettable (even though you're the fan of both games).

- Also, officially, although RTX-enabled worlds cannot be downloaded thus be created on devices without ray-tracing hardware and support, players who don't have ray-tracing hardware and support (even mobile) can join players with ray-tracing hardware whose playing RTX-enabled worlds. However official version of Super Mario Mash-up Pack not only can't be created on PC because it's not available in Minecraft Marketplace, on Nintendo Switch, it's resource pack also forcefully disables cross-platform multiplayer so it can only be joined by players on Nintendo Switches, and it cannot be reverted even by deleting the one a world has cached with, so you cannot play with players that are on PC or even mobile.

- players who use Android devices, XBOX players and PC players and play Minecraft Preview but does not have a ray-tracing hardware / support can alternatively use Deferred Rendering (Ray-tracing-like custom shaders if put with ray-tracing enabled resource packs), but there's no official alternatives to playing Super Mario Mash-up Pack if even PC players or mobile players wants to.

- TL;DR: Ray-tracing can only be used on PC with ray-tracing hardware but those who do not have one can join in other's ray-tracing-enabled world or in Minecraft Preview, use deferred rendering, while Super Mario Mash-up Pack can only be used on Nintendo Switch, forcefully disables cross-platform multiplayer, breaks ability for future cross-platform multiplayer if the pack was used on a world once, and there's no official alternatives or workarounds.

- source: https://help.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/articles/4408894129933#h_01GK594JS1RQMYGF39SRT9J1ST , goes to "WHAT ADDITIONAL CONTENT IS INCLUDED?" but sourced from "CAN MY FRIENDS ON XBOX PLAY THE SUPER MARIO MASH-UP?" BS question.

## Why is piracy justified despite it's illegal? How can Mojang fix that?
- As previous, piracy is illegal because it is a form of unaurthorized distribution. Not only that, you will get into shady websites that has potential malwares.
- however, right now people risk it because pirated copy give out more flexibility than paid, official versions, it now innovates more than official versions. By just pirating it and then patching it, or just download the patched version, pirates can use it more freely than those who bought for official versions.

- To get it fixed, Mojang have to make paid versions in par of pirated copies (by adding features to official versions that pirated copies had, and removing restrictions against freedom on official versions, where pirated copies do not.), **NOT PIRATED COPIES IN PAR WITH PAID VERSIONS**. Or to make piracy unjustifiable, we should add features that pirated copies had, to official versions and removing restrictions against freedom in official versions that pirated copies did not. **Brute-forcing a way to make anti-piracy more powerful, threatening a take-down while not lifting off restrictions on official versions are not a solution, and is violence, a waste of money and full-on retarded behavior.**

## Did Nintendo use Super Mario Mash-up Pack as a promotion for Minecraft (for Nintendo Switch) in 2023?
- Yes, I found some Minecraft Promotion in Nintendo that used Super Mario Mash-up Pack, in 2023, like
- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmYAKpGo-B0
- https://twitter.com/NintendoAmerica/status/1620527350344450050
- i think it's weird to not make that to other platforms of Minecraft.

# Platform Restriction DRM (hardest call-out question, Companies might get angry for me calling them out)

## What restrictions did Mojang put so it tells the game that the content is platform / multiplayer restricted?
- `"platform_lock": true` (source: https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/70vu0u/how_the_super_mario_pack_will_be_restricted_in/) and `"pack_scope": "world"` (source: https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-160631)
- For `"platform_lock"`, when it's set to true, on the resource pack, behavior pack or skin-pack, and you use one of them, Minecraft will forcefully disable multiplayer or cross-platform multiplayer depending which platform you use.
- wheres `"pack_scope"` is used to limit where the resource pack can be used in, if it's set to `"global"`, the pack will be restricted to only be used as global resource and `"world"` will restrict it to only be used in the world. it's stupid that it's "Working as Intended" when it is set-up as an anti-feature for customization on-device only! (source: https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-160631) update: some UI on the menu are not changed.
- Mojang / Nintendo could've updated the license, removed restrictions, updated it's thumbnail to have the license shown up, and have it put to Minecraft Marketplace, **it's stupid easy, it only takes 3 weeks maximum**

## What other contents were affected by `"platform_lock": true` and what is it?
 - carries over XBOX versions of Minecraft, with multiplayer disabled in Bedrock counterpart due to the licensing issue (with Marvel and / or Disney):
   - Marvel Avengers Skin Pack
   - Marvel Spider-Man Skin Pack
   - Marvel Guardians of the Galaxy Skin Pack
 - carries over XBOX versions of Minecraft, with multiplayer disabled in Bedrock counterpart due to the licensing issue (with Fox Broadcasting Company and / or Disney):
   - Simpsons Skin Pack
     
 - However there are no mentions of Super Mario Mash-up Pack being platform-restricted due to licensing issues in the source.
 - source: https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/better-together-faq

 - Also there are no mentions of LittleBigPlanet Mash-up Pack being platform-restricted.  
 - ...And contents you want to restrict if you want to be evil.
  
 - It is a flag that prevents players from using it in multiplayer, which so it is to "avoid potential licensing issues", however these contents are straight-up ported to other versions of the game (from Console Edition to Bedrock for console) so i think it's ironic to say it was "licensing issue" when you ported the contents from one to another, even though they serve the same purpose.
