# minecraft-mario-mashup-pack
If you are there, this is a god-tier honeypot that trips Nintendo and Mojang, no content is included even in multiple resporities.
This is about a call-out about Mojang and Nintendo that they are taking piracy in joking and / or retarded way

# QNA
## Will you put contents from Super Mario Mash-up Pack there?
- No, because then this will not be a honeypot and getting it removed for DMCA violation will be fully justified.
- Piracy is morally correct in this case but it's still illegal regardless it's moral or not, because it is a form of unaurthorized distribution, even thoough this gives out the oppounity for users who do not wish to use Nintendo Switch to be able to use more freely on mobile and PC.
- i don't know if the extra $10 in Minecraft for Nintendo Switch is the cost of Super Mario Mash-up Pack, or it was the tax and the mash-up pack was actually free by using the word "include", either way i paid for it or i claimed that so i own it, but then i would either risk rich <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karen_(slang)>karen</a> threats for putting in or community backlash for not putting in. and since there's multiples of that in the internet, i am not going to risk rich <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karen_(slang)>karen</a> threats for putting it in anyways.

## Why is this file existed? Explain like I'm 5.
- I found skins from Super Mario Mashup Pack were not cross-platform the hard way, I found an exploit, I made a bug report for that, I upvoted <a href=https://feedback.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/community/posts/360021759332--Licensed-Content-Super-Mario-mashup> one "suggession" in Minecraft Feedback</a>, I begged Mojang for Super Mario Mash-up Pack in PC and mobile, Mojang said it was licensing issue and told me to blame Nintendo, went toxic and ghost / mute me begging and finding out the truth, i cannot contact Nintendo cuz it's unrelated to all of methods. I had to call them out.
- For PC it's Microsoft Windows (and Apple MacOS if there were one), for mobile it's iOS, iPadOS, Android and Fire.
- Did not include XBOX and PS because these are consoles from Nintendo's competitors.
  
### the beg was also about making Super Mario Mash-up Pack available to Minecraft Marketplace for following reasons:
  - Piracy issue, because even though piracy itself is illegal, the mash-up pack is not available in Minecraft Marketplace in the first place and pirating it and getting it patched right now is the only solution for cross-platform usage.
  - I found the <a href=https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-163175>exploit that would be benefitial to the community</a> if the platform-restriction anti-feature itself were removed (Private, Marked as "Fixed" since early 2024, even though it was by adding the platform-restriction anti-feature detection to event servers to users in mid 2023) and in 2024, i accidentally discovered <a href=https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-178032>a workaround</a> (Mojang set it private without any of my input due to secerts in images uploaded by me or it was put in "Super Mario Mash-up Pack workaround"'s top result in Google, invalidated due to it "being a feature request", despite the fix was to **remove all signs of EULA-roofing by making it available to cross-platform multiplayer and even to Minecraft Marketplace**)
  - Super Mario Mash-up Pack's IP license / copyright was not on the thumbnail (but located in Settings>General), unlike current licensed contents in Minecraft Marketplace (this is the most obivious without any cracking, just buy a Nintendo Switch, the game and a licensed content from Minecraft Marketplace.)
  - Mojang and Nintendo could've added the mash-up pack separately in Minecraft Marketplace so anyone who wants to use the mash-up pack outside Nintendo Switch should pay for one, and profits of the mash-up pack can go to Nintendo.
  - The physical game box of Minecraft for Nintendo Switch i got, did not claim that the Super Mario Mash-up Pack is platform-specific mash-up pack.
  - They could've kept the claim consistent if it was not "Licensing issue" BS.
    - I did not find out it was platform-restricted until i tried to apply the skin in the multiplayer and I found one against using Super Mario Mash-up Pack in other platforms on a FAQ.
    - the physical game box on mine isn't changed yet, although the digital, default version of the game no longer said that it included Super Mario Mash-up Pack, Deleuxe version and physical box of the game said so without adding any disclaimer, having to have players (including me) then find out they were forcefully set multiplayer from cross-platform, to platform-specific at best, or forcefully disable all multiplayer at worst, and only to get worsened in the FAQ, if FAQs were the EULA, this would be an example of EULA roofing (EULA roofying).
    - overall their moves made the claim very inconsistent.

#### Proof of one the clearest answer (for real) replied from Minecraft Help (Minecraft Support) sent from me in October 2023 

<img width=80% alt="The question created in October 2023" src="https://github.com/panglikesheep18/minecraft-mario-mashup-pack/assets/94123276/f4e7783e-9323-41b2-a0b3-eeb04d443bf5">

- the question is created back in October 2023, as you look at the image, with some of the reasons that's put above.

<img width=80% alt="Clearest answer regarding Super Mario Mash-up Pack not being put to Minecraft Marketplace, one Minecraft Help Staff proved it's due to licensing issues, so i photoshopped a red rectangle outside the licensing issue for people to traget, also, despite me only saying people were porting the mash-up pack, they said they don't give support about third-party sites and launchers, and do not give support to those who are playing the game on VMs (emulators) and gave me a now-broken link to third-party services and websites (that would go to Minecraft: Java Edition Account Security FAQ)" src="https://github.com/panglikesheep18/minecraft-mario-mashup-pack/assets/94123276/712f7921-a92f-498e-80a5-453a8a90ce46">

- On the image, the root reason is in the red rectangle, and i've shortened the other reasons that's not on red rectangle for you to look for.

#### on early 2024, i sent another ticket, explicitly listing why Super Mario Mash-up Pack disabled cross-platform multiplayer and the date of it being on the Minecraft Marketplace (will not be put until the exact time it released), before i accidentally found a workaround
<img width=80% alt="i sent a ticket for needing a reason of why it forcefully disabled cross platform multiplayer when i used one part of Super Mario Mash-up Pack and (Redacted)" src="https://github.com/panglikesheep18/minecraft-mario-mashup-pack/assets/94123276/0e8ae416-3c13-44c4-9e1b-b61ea8fc67e7">

- By the time i was trying to get a clear explanation, i accidentally found a workaround while joining my server, which would allow players to have more freedom on some skin-packs they have on their device, this was one of ways i can avoid getting into legal trouble because i don't have to pirate one from the internet. The only issue is it is still Nintendo Switch specific.

<img width=80% alt="one of Minecraft Help (or Minecraft Support) staff claimed Super Mario Mash-up Pack is a collaboration between Mojang and Nintendo and thus being exclusive to Nintendo platforms, also, 'no information regarding whether other platforms can also have the mash-up pack in Minecraft Marketplace'" src="https://github.com/panglikesheep18/minecraft-mario-mashup-pack/assets/94123276/c0143a31-54fc-481a-9d93-d9aa5434f24d">

<img width=80% alt="i then called them out for being platform restricted was the reason being the mashup pack was collaborated between Mojang and Nintendo, as if Halo, Sonic and Mega Man X were all platform specific, i also called them out for gate-keeping the mash-up pack, EULA-roofing, and thus scamming people" src="https://github.com/panglikesheep18/minecraft-mario-mashup-pack/assets/94123276/21c25f11-0313-418a-ba81-0bca9805f26d">

- since being platform-specific due to it being a collaboration between Mojang and Nintendo, is too ridiculous and i cannot contact Nintendo with such methods, and i think Mojang (and even Nintendo) would have no problem releasing the mash-up pack to Marketplace, i called "Minecraft Help" out by saying if such logic was applied, then should Halo, Sonic and Mega-Man be also platform-restricted because of collaborations with 343 Industries / Bungie, SEGA and CAPCOM and Mojang or Marketplace partners, and platform exclusivity on Halo and exclude platform on Sonic and Mega-Man X, and them gate-keeping the Super Mario Mash-up Pack from being played on cross-playform multiplayer in my opinion, so we had to download (or even risking legal issues such as pirating) the mash-up pack from the internet.

- based of inital releases and most released platforms in franchises vs. ones in Minecraft, i found them inconsistent.

* Please note that both Minecraft and Halo are owned by Microsoft

- I did not add the following contexts such as
  - if it was platform-restricted based of initial releases of original games, shouldn't Sonic be even made? should Mega-Man X in Minecraft be exclusive to PS, Nintendo Switch, PC and mobile (or even Nintendo Switch only if based of earliest release)?
  - Also, if we travel to present timeline, Super Mario Run and Mario Kart Tour are available exclusively to mobile, not even Nintendo consoles. So should Super Mario Mash-up Pack be also available to mobile?

<img width=80% alt="One Minecraft staff claimed the mash-up pack being platform-specific to Nintendo Switch because of not only Mojang's, but also Nintendo's decision" src="https://github.com/panglikesheep18/minecraft-mario-mashup-pack/assets/94123276/fa93bb39-6c75-4dde-b94f-456817111b9f">

<img width=80% alt="i have put the link for platform decay topic 'If buying isn't owning, piracy isn't stealing' and the analogy of what if they downloaded the content from me and i have set-up restrictions for licensing issue despite them being able to use the content with zero risk if they had to remove the restriction just to be able to enjoy the content they've downloaded" src="https://github.com/panglikesheep18/minecraft-mario-mashup-pack/assets/94123276/522a22ef-4242-4832-94f9-7feec9c300dd">

Link to the Pluralistic: "If buying isn't owning, piracy isn't stealing" is <a href=https://pluralistic.net/2023/12/08/playstationed/#tyler-james-hill>here</a>.

- This had me found out inconsistency in Minecraft Help between time, with some staffs claiming it was "Licensing issues", some "no info" and even some "Blame Nintendo", further proving it is a gate-keep for me.

<img width=80% alt="Minecraft Support Staff cannot make the Super Mario Mash-up Pack available to Minecraft Marketplace (Cross-platform) because they have no power to do so in the first place, and thus cancelled the ticket, but based of the message, they did not react to my analogy before getting the ticket canceled" src="https://github.com/panglikesheep18/minecraft-mario-mashup-pack/assets/94123276/853f7930-f477-4b89-b8fd-7ed9af33d2c2">

- They have canceled the ticket for them not powerful enough to do such, but i did not see them reacting to my analogy so they did not read my analogy before cancelling the ticket!

#### i had also contacted local Nintendo by saying "i have a question, is with nintendo switch online, if i could play with players of other platforms with Minecraft: Deluxe Collection or just in Minecraft, can i be able to play Super Mario Mash-up Pack with players of other platforms or even using skins from Super Mario Mash-up Pack for playing worlds hosted from other-platform?", even though it's parent company is the licensee, they said "...We don't have any information about the game (Minecraft), consider contacting the developer of the game (Mojang)"

## Wait, who made Super Mario Mash-up Pack?
- In my opinion, Mojang Studios, 4J Studios and Nintendo made the mash-up pack, with Nintendo licensing it.

## Hold up, RTX feature (such as Ray-tracing) is currently PC-exclusive, can you tell me some differences between it and the Super Mario Mash-up Pack? (as a Microsoft Windows PC user)
- Officially, Super Mario Mash-up Pack is the DLC / mash-up pack currently included (bundled) on Nintendo Switch, while ray-tracing is a feature that currently requires NVIDIA GeForce RTX or AMD Radeon RX 6000 or better to work.

- Currently, you can buy an NVIDIA GeForce RTX / AMD Radeon RX graphics card for your PC to play with official ray-tracing. But you cannot buy the official version of Super Mario Mash-up Pack or even download one to your PC and you need to download the unofficial one from the internet, the only legal way to use the Super Mario Mash-up Pack if you won't use PC is to buy a Nintendo hardware, and so the mash-up pack is easily forgettable (even though you were the fan of both games).

- Also, officially, although RTX-enabled worlds cannot be downloaded or be created on devices without ray-tracing hardware and support, players who don't have ray-tracing hardware and support (even mobile) can join players with ray-tracing hardware whose playing RTX-enabled worlds. However official version of Super Mario Mash-up Pack not only can't be created on PC because it's not available in Minecraft Marketplace, on Nintendo Switch, it's resource pack also forcefully disables cross-platform multiplayer so it can only be joined by players on Nintendo Switches, and it cannot be reverted even by deleting the one a world has cached with, so you cannot play with players that are on PC or even mobile.

- players who use Android devices, XBOX and PC, and play Minecraft Preview, regardless having a ray-tracing hardware / support or not, can alternatively use Deferred Rendering (Ray-tracing-like custom shaders if put with ray-tracing enabled resource packs). But there's no official alternatives to playing Super Mario Mash-up Pack if even PC players or mobile players wants to, and community-made workarounds require intense and technical procedure and they will risk getting broken and defeated by an anti-feature from a DRM in future revisions or versions.

- TL;DR: Ray-tracing can only be used on PC with ray-tracing hardware but those who do not have one can join in other's ray-tracing-enabled world or in Minecraft Preview, use deferred rendering, while Super Mario Mash-up Pack can only be used on Nintendo Switch, forcefully disables cross-platform multiplayer, breaks ability for future cross-platform multiplayer on a world if the pack was used on it once, and there's no official alternatives or workarounds.

- source: https://help.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/articles/4408894129933#h_01GK594JS1RQMYGF39SRT9J1ST , goes to "WHAT ADDITIONAL CONTENT IS INCLUDED?" but sourced from "CAN MY FRIENDS ON XBOX PLAY THE SUPER MARIO MASH-UP?" BS question.

## Why is piracy justified despite it's illegal? How can Mojang fix that?
- As previous, piracy is illegal because it is a form of unaurthorized distribution. Not only that, you will go to shady websites that has potential malwares.
- however, right now people risk it because pirated copy give out more flexibility than paid, official versions, it now innovates more than official versions. By just pirating it and then patching it, or just download the patched version, pirates can use it more freely than those who bought for official versions.

- To get it fixed, Mojang have to make paid versions in par of pirated copies (by adding features to official versions that pirated copies had, and removing restrictions against freedom on official versions, where pirated copies do not.), **NOT PIRATED COPIES IN PAR WITH PAID VERSIONS**. Or to make piracy unjustifiable, we should add features that pirated copies had, to official versions and removing restrictions against freedom in official versions that pirated copies did not. **Brute-forcing a way to make anti-piracy more powerful, threatening a take-down while not lifting off restrictions on official versions are not a solution, and is violence, a waste of money and full-on retarded behavior.**

## Did Nintendo use Super Mario Mash-up Pack as a promotion for Minecraft (for Nintendo Switch) in 2023?
- Yes, I found some Minecraft Promotion in Nintendo that used Super Mario Mash-up Pack, in 2023, like
- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmYAKpGo-B0
- https://twitter.com/NintendoAmerica/status/1620527350344450050
- i think it's weird to not make that to other platforms of Minecraft.

## What is the workaround to the issue if users wanted to play cross-platform with skins from Super Mario Mash-up Pack anyways?
- A vague explanation of my workaround can be found <a href=https://feedback.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/community/posts/360021759332/comments/23409371173773>here</a> , please note that it will be defeated and become ineffective in the future update, if so, i will update it to prove it defeated. Even though i intended the discovery to be so you could play with friends in your or friend's world (not Realms or featured server) in the skin. As stated, this workaround only applies to skins. I wished the Super Mario Mash-up Pack was made to Minecraft Marketplace for people that like to use PC or mobile so they can enjoy these without having to do the workaround.

## What is the current solution to the issue if Mojang and Nintendo did not put the mash-up pack to multiple platforms?
- People said <a href="https://www.planetminecraft.com/resources/?keywords=mario">using custom skins from the internet with mobile and PC as a solution</a>, but little did they know, if they were playing the game on PC, with an extra app to import the skin-pack, and some seriousness, they can also download the mash-up pack from the same internet and have enjoyed these on PC that was only used for Nintendo Switch players according to the BS. for example, SRG's Skinpack, Minecraft Super Mario Edition 1.2.0 and the Minecraft Java port of the map from Super Mario Mash-up Pack.

- our reasonings are two of proofs why no one gave a damn even though the mash-up pack is not available to be purchased in PC or mobile in the first place. They are Nintendo and Mojang's service (skill) issues. Should Nintendo and Mojang wake-up and put the mash-up pack to Minecraft Marketplace, with no platform restrictions, so people can then get the mash-up pack on platforms people want in easier way?
