# minecraft-mario-mashup-pack
If you are there, this is a god-tier honeypot that trips Nintendo and Mojang, no content is included even in multiple resporities.

# QNA

## Why is this file existed? Explain like I'm 5.
- I found skins from Super Mario Mashup Pack were not cross-platform the hard way, I found an exploit, I made a bug report for that, I upvoted <a href=https://feedback.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/community/posts/360021759332--Licensed-Content-Super-Mario-mashup> one "suggession" in Minecraft Feedback</a>, I begged Mojang for Super Mario Mash-up Pack in PC and mobile, Mojang said it was licensing issue and told me to blame Nintendo, went toxic and ghost / ban me begging and finding out the truth, i cannot contact Nintendo cuz it's unrelated to all of methods. I had to call them out.
- For PC it's Microsoft Windows (and Apple MacOS if there were one), for mobile it's iOS, iPadOS, Android and Fire
- Did not include XBOX and PS because these are consoles from Nintendo's competitors.
  
- the beg was also about making Super Mario Mash-up Pack available to Minecraft Marketplace for following reasons:
  - Piracy issue because it's not available in Minecraft Marketplace in the first place and pirating it right now is the only solution for cross-platform usage.
  - Super Mario Mash-up Pack's IP license / copyright was not on the thumbnail, unlike current licensed contents in Minecraft Marketplace
  - Mojang and Nintendo could've added the mash-up pack separately in Minecraft Marketplace so anyone who wants to use the mash-up pack outside Nintendo Switch should pay for one, and all profits of the mash-up pack can go to Nintendo.
  - The physical game box of Minecraft for Nintendo Switch, did not claim that the Super Mario Mash-up Pack is platform-specific mash-up pack.
  - I did not find out it was platform-restricted until i tried to apply the skin in the multiplayer or I found one against using Super Mario Mash-up Pack in other platforms on a FAQ.

## Why is piracy justified despite it's illegal? How can Mojang fix that?
- As previous, piracy is illegal because it is a form of unaurthorized distribution.
- however, right now people risk it because pirated copy give out more flexibility than paid versions, it innovates. By just pirating it and then patching it, or just download the patched version.
- To get it fixed, Mojang have to make paid versions in par of pirated copies (by adding features to official versions that pirated copies had, and removing restrictions against freedom on official versions, where pirated copies do not.), **NOT PIRATED COPIES IN PAR WITH PAID VERSIONS**. Or to make piracy unjustifiable, we should add features that pirated copies had, to official versions and removing restrictions against freedom in official versions that pirated copies did not. **Brute-forcing a way to make anti-piracy more powerful, threatening a take-down while not lifting off restrictions on official versions are not a solution, and is violence, a waste of money and full-on retarded behavior.**

## Did Nintendo use Super Mario Mash-up Pack as a promotion for Minecraft (for Nintendo Switch)?
- Yes, I found some Minecraft Promotion in Nintendo that used Super Mario Mash-up Pack, in 2023, like
- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmYAKpGo-B0
- https://twitter.com/NintendoAmerica/status/1620527350344450050
- i think it's weird to not make that to other platforms of Minecraft.

# Platform Restriction DRM (hardest call-out question, Companies might get angry for me calling them out)

## What restrictions did Mojang put so it tells the game that the content is platform / multiplayer restricted?
- `"platform_lock": true` (https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/70vu0u/how_the_super_mario_pack_will_be_restricted_in/) and `"pack_scope": "world"` (https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-160631)
- For `"platform_lock"`, when it's set to true, on the resource pack, behavior pack or skin-pack, and you use one of them, Minecraft will forcefully disable multiplayer or cross-platform multiplayer depending which platform you use.
- wheres `"pack_scope"` is used to limit where the resource pack can be used in, if it's set to `"global"`, the pack will be restricted to only be used as global resource and `"world"` will restrict it to only be used in the world. it's stupid that it's "Working as Intended" when it is set-up as an anti-feature for customization on-device only! (https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-160631)
- Mojang / Nintendo could've updated the license, removed restrictions, updated it's thumbnail to have the license shown up, and have it put to Minecraft Marketplace, **it's stupid easy, it only takes 3 weeks maximum**

## What other contents were affected by `"platform_lock": true` and what is it?
 - carries over XBOX versions of Minecraft, with multiplayer disabled in Bedrock counterpart due to the licensing issue (with Marvel and / or Disney):
   - Marvel Avengers Skin Pack
   - Marvel Spider-Man Skin Pack
   - Marvel Guardians of the Galaxy Skin Pack
 - carries over XBOX versions of Minecraft, with multiplayer disabled in Bedrock counterpart due to the licensing issue (with Fox Broadcasting Company and / or Disney):
   - Simpsons Skin Pack
     
 - However there are no mentions of Super Mario Mash-up Pack being platform-restricted due to licensing issues in the source.
 - source: https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/better-together-faq

 - Also there are no mentions of LittleBigPlanet Mash-up Pack being platform-restricted.  
 - ...And contents you want to restrict if you want to be evil.
  
 - It is a flag that prevents players from using it in multiplayer, which so it is to "avoid potential licensing issues", however these contents are straight-up ported to other versions of the game (from Console to Bedrock) so it's ironic to not fix these things up.
