## Disclaimer: none of usable part of the mash-up pack is included even in multiple resporities i've created. Please look at QNA "Will you put contents from Super Mario Mash-up Pack there?" for details.

This is about a request and beg about Mojang and Nintendo that i want them to make Super Mario Mash-up Pack to multiple platforms (especially PC and mobile).

For quick reason why it should be put (without also reading why the restriction is bad), please check [here](./reasons_to_put_to_PC_and_smart_device.md)

# QNA
## Will you put contents from Super Mario Mash-up Pack there?
- No, because then this will not be a honeypot and getting it removed from them will be fully justified.
- Piracy is illegal regardless it's moral or not, because it is a form of unaurthorized distribution, even thoough this gives out the oppounity for users who do not wish to use Nintendo Switch to be able to use more freely on mobile and PC.
- i don't know if the extra $10 in Minecraft for Nintendo Switch is the cost of Super Mario Mash-up Pack, or it was the tax and the mash-up pack was actually free by using the word "include", either way i paid for it or i claimed that so i own it, but then i would either risk rich [karen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karen_(slang)) threats for putting in or community backlash for not putting in. and since there's multiples of that in the internet, i am not going to risk rich [karen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karen_(slang)) threats for putting it in anyways.
- i want to get the mash-up pack in official way so bad

## Why is this file existed? Explain like I'm 5.
- I found skins from Super Mario Mash-up Pack were not cross-platform the hard way, I made bug reports for that, I upvoted [one "suggession" in Minecraft Feedback](https://feedback.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/community/posts/360021759332--Licensed-Content-Super-Mario-mashup), I begged Mojang for Super Mario Mash-up Pack in PC and mobile, Mojang said it was licensing issue and / or planned platform exclusivity, and claimed would be fixed "soon", i went too far and got myself muted / banned. I cannot contact Nintendo cuz it's unrelated to all of methods. So I called them out in fit of rage.
- i had discovered a workaround to the issue i am having, and created a bug report with the workaround as an workaround, in a fit of rage.
- For PC it's Microsoft Windows, for mobile it's iOS, iPadOS, Android and Fire.
- Did not include XBOX and PS because these are consoles from Nintendo's competitors.

- Overall creation of this repository is motivated entirely because the Super Mario Mash-up Pack is too restrictive and too specific and i very hate the restrictions put and i think the mash-up pack should be made usable on PC and mobile. Once the mash-up pack was officially made to PC and mobile, i would archive this repository.
  
### the beg was also about making Super Mario Mash-up Pack available to multiple platforms for following reasons (orders from common to ridiculous):
  - Super Mario Mash-up Pack's IP license / copyright was not on the thumbnail (but located in Settings>General), unlike current licensed contents in Minecraft Marketplace (this is the most obivious without any cracking, just buy a Nintendo Switch, the game and a licensed content from Minecraft Marketplace.)
  - I cannot search one on Minecraft Marketplace catalog even in search on Nintendo Switch.
  - [Nintendo could've added a way to redeem for a mash-up pack on their site for use on PC and mobile](https://feedback.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/community/posts/360021759332/comments/25465641914125)
  - Mojang and Nintendo could've added the mash-up pack separately in Minecraft Marketplace (on PC and mobile) so anyone who wants to use the mash-up pack outside Nintendo Switch should pay for one, and profits of the mash-up pack can go to Nintendo.
  - The physical game box of Minecraft for Nintendo Switch i got, did not claim that the Super Mario Mash-up Pack is platform-specific mash-up pack.
  - I accidentally discovered a workaround (currently defeated).
  - They could've kept the claim consistent if it was not "Licensing issue" (gate-keeping).
  - I did not find out it was platform-restricted until i tried to apply the skin in cross-platform multiplayer and to add insult to injury, I then found one FAQ that said that the mash-up pack can't be used on multiplayer.
  - The physical game box on mine isn't changed yet, although the default version of the game on digital store no longer said that it included Super Mario Mash-up Pack, Deleuxe version and physical box of the game said so without adding any disclaimer (as if the Super Mario Mash-up Pack could be treated the same as other Marketplace contents that could be used on cross-platform multiplayer), having to have players (including me) then purchase it to find that they forcefully set multiplayer from cross-platform, to platform-specific at best, or [forcefully disabled at worst](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-189600).
  - [Updates to this mash-up pack cannot be done without the game's updating](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-185721?focusedId=1348926&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-1348926) [(Video from ibxtoycat of him trying to update the mash-up pack and failing)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EIgSI5E_uE&t=540s)
   
### Proofs of the issue that make me support in flavor of making Super Mario Mash-up Pack to multiple platforms:
  - ~~The physical game card box does not have a disclaimer~~ no longer an issue to new copies since mid 2024
  - Platform restriction feature is broken with me finding a workaround to it and [people's discovery of it taking too far in Create World Screen](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-188434)
  - [Inconsistencies between the trailer and my experience, and even the video itself](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/WEB-7134)
   
### Since October 2023, i have contacted Minecraft Support (part of Minecraft Help) for issues with the mash-up pack and if they could put it up (with Nintendo) to Minecraft Marketplace (for PC and mobile players to enjoy) because of piracy issue and i had to download Super Mario Mash-up Pack from the internet when i wanted to use it on other officially-supported platform because there is no way to get it in Minecraft Marketplace on PC and mobile officially, and they claimed that mash-up pack is already a Marketplace content, even though i cannot search for one on a catalog, and said they couldn't because it's 2 of the worst duo, licensing issue and (or) planned platform exclusivity. Until May 2024, over multiple attempts to ask / beg Minecraft to put the mash-up pack to multiple platforms, 3 of attempts resulted in Support staffs putting out reasons, with 2 of them being obviously "licensing issue" and the other one being planned platform exclusivity with no proper reasoning.

### i had also contacted local Nintendo by saying "i have a question, is with nintendo switch online. if i could play with players of other platforms with Minecraft: Deluxe Collection or just in Minecraft, can i be able to play Super Mario Mash-up Pack with players of other platforms or even using skins from Super Mario Mash-up Pack for playing worlds hosted from other-platform?", even though it's parent company is the licensee, they said "...We don't have any information about the game (Minecraft), consider contacting the developer of the game (Mojang)"

### in March and May, i tried contacting Minecraft Support again, with workarounds, one is that i got conviced after the FAQs were removed, and another is if the mash-up pack would be released in multiple platforms with the licensee in few weeks, with both "unable to confirm" (or "confirming that's not" in staff's speak), despite those in Minecraft Help no longer existing in early 2024. although the case's closed without banning in former attempt (because i did not say if i was screwed in that attempt), the lattter attempt resulted in me being ghosted again and an artificial ban after i asked if i was screwed if i had the game for other platforms and wanted the mash-up pack but without the Nintendo Switch. which i did not ever have rage speech, so it's an insanely immature take, because of that, i cannot also report any issue about toxic reviewer in Minecraft Feedback.

### The longer they gate-keep the mash-up pack from officially being usable on PC and mobile, the more mad i am.

## Wait, who made Super Mario Mash-up Pack?
- In my opinion, Mojang Studios, 4J Studios and Nintendo made the mash-up pack, with Nintendo licensing it.

## Did Nintendo use Super Mario Mash-up Pack as a promotion for Minecraft (for Nintendo Switch) in 2023 and onwards?
- Yes, I found some Minecraft Promotion in Nintendo that used Super Mario Mash-up Pack, in 2023 to 2024, like
- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmYAKpGo-B0
- https://twitter.com/NintendoAmerica/status/1620527350344450050
- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TsDr9Qow94 ([most inconsistent with disclaimer at 0:51 being against a footage in 0:33 to 0:35](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/WEB-7134) [look at the top right of the video carefully])

## What is the current solution to the issue if Mojang and Nintendo did not put the mash-up pack to multiple platforms?
- People said <a href="https://www.planetminecraft.com/resources/?keywords=mario">using custom skins from the internet with mobile and PC as a solution</a>, but they can also download the mash-up pack itself from the same internet and have enjoyed these on PC with some workaorunds that was only used for Nintendo Switch players according to the BS.

# For how it's worked, please check [here](./Platform-restriction-DRM-in-MCBE-1.20-the-hardest-callout-question.md), please note this is technical and would be deleted if it made karens mad.
