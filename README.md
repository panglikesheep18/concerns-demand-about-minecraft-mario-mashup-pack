# minecraft-mario-mashup-pack
If you are there, this is a god-tier honeypot that trips Nintendo and Mojang, no content is included even in multiple resporities.

QNA

Will you put contents from Super Mario Mash-up Pack there?
- No, because then this will not be a honeypot and getting it removed for DMCA violation will be fully justified.
- Piracy is morally correct in this case but it's still illegal regardless it's moral or not, because it is a form of unaurthorized distribution, even thoough this gives out the oppounity for users who do not wish to use Nintendo Switch to be able to use more freely on mobile.

Why is this repo existed? Explain like I'm 5.
- I made a bug report, I begged Mojang for Super Mario Mash-up Pack in PC and mobile, Mojang said it was licensing issue and told me to blame Nintendo, went toxic and ghost / ban me begging and finding out the truth, i cannot contact Nintendo cuz it's unrelated to all of methods. I had to call them out.
- For PC it's Microsoft Windows (and Apple MacOS if there were one), for mobile it's iOS, iPadOS, Android and Fire
- Did not include XBOX and PS because these are consoles from Nintendo's competitors.
  
- the beg was also about making Super Mario Mash-up Pack available to Minecraft Marketplace for following reasons:
  - Piracy issue because it's not available in Minecraft Marketplace in the first place and pirating it right is the only solution to give more freedom of use.
  - Super Mario Mash-up Pack's IP license / copyright was not on the thumbnail, unlike contents in Minecraft Marketplace
  - Mojang and Nintendo could've added the mash-up pack separately in Minecraft Marketplace so anyone who wants to use the mash-up pack outside Nintendo Switch should pay for one.
  - I found it flawed the hard way
  - I did not find out it was platform-restricted until i tried to apply the skin in the multiplayer and i found one against such on a FAQ.

Why is piracy justified despide it's illegal? How can the developers fix that?
- As previous, piracy is illegal because it is a form of unaurthorized distribution.
- however, right now people risk it because pirated copy give out more flexibility than paid versions, it innovates. By just pirating it and then patching it, or just download the patched version.
- To get it fixed, developers have to make paid versions in par of pirated copies (by adding features to official versions that pirated copies had, and removing restrictions against freedom on official versions, where pirated copies do not.), **NOT PIRATED COPIES IN PAR WITH PAID VERSIONS**. Or to make piracy unjustifiable, we should add features that pirated copies had, to official versions and removing restrictions against freedom in official versions that pirated copies did not. **Brute-forcing a way to make anti-piracy more powerful, threatening a take-down while not lifting off restrictions on official versions are not a solution, and is violence, a waste of money and full-on retarded behavior.**

Platform Restriction DRM (hardest call-out question)

What restrictions did Mojang put so it tells the game that the content is platform / multiplayer restricted?
- `"platform_lock": true` (https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/70vu0u/how_the_super_mario_pack_will_be_restricted_in/) and `"pack_scope": "world"` (https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-160631)
- For `"platform_lock"`, when it's set to true, on the resource pack, behavior pack or skin-pack, and you use one of them, Minecraft will forcefully disable multiplayer or cross-platform multiplayer depending which platform you use.
- wheres `"pack_scope"` is used to limit where it can be used in, if it's set to `"global"`, the pack will be restricted to global only and `"world"` will restrict it to only be set in the world. it's stupid that it's WAI when it is set-up as an anti-feature for customization! (https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-160631)
- Mojang / Nintendo could've just removed restrictions, updated it's thumbnail to have the license shown up, and have it put to Minecraft Marketplace, **it's stupid easy, it only takes 3 weeks maximum**

What other contents were affected by `"platform_lock": true` and what is it?
 - carries over XBOX versions of Minecraft, with multiplayer disabled in Bedrock counterpart due to the licensing issue with Marvel:
   - Marvel Avengers Skin Pack
   - Marvel Spider-Man Skin Pack
   - Marvel Guardians of the Galaxy Skin Pack
 - carries over XBOX versions of Minecraft, with multiplayer disabled in Bedrock counterpart due to the licensing issue with Fox Media:
   - Simpsons Skin Pack

 - other content you want to restrict if you want to be evil.
 - source: https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/better-together-faq
 - However there are no mentions of Super Mario Mash-up Pack.
  
 - It is a flag that prevents players from using it in multiplayer, which so it is to "avoid potential licensing issues", however these contents are straight-up ported to other versions of the game (from Console to Bedrock) so it's ironic to not fix these things up.

Did Nintendo use uper Mario Mash-up Pack as a promotion for Minecraft (for Nintendo Switch)?
- Yes, I found some Minecraft Promotion in Nintendo that used Super Mario Mash-up Pack, in 2023, like
