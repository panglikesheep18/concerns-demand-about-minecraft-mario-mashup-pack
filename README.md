## Disclaimer: none of usable part of the mash-up pack is included even in multiple resporities i've created. Please look at QNA "Will you put contents from Super Mario Mash-up Pack there?" for details.

This is about a request and beg about Mojang and Nintendo that i want them to make Super Mario Mash-up Pack to multiple platforms (especially PC and mobile).

Despite me (i mean me there) being de-indexed on Google (which means the honepot is obviously working), I would keep an update without making anyone angry.

# QNA
## Will you put contents from Super Mario Mash-up Pack there?
- No, because then this will not be a honeypot and getting it removed from them will be fully justified.
- Piracy is illegal regardless it's moral or not, because it is a form of unaurthorized distribution, even thoough this gives out the oppounity for users who do not wish to use Nintendo Switch to be able to use more freely on mobile and PC.
- i don't know if the extra $10 in Minecraft for Nintendo Switch is the cost of Super Mario Mash-up Pack, or it was the tax and the mash-up pack was actually free by using the word "include", either way i paid for it or i claimed that so i own it, but then i would either risk rich [karen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karen_(slang)) threats for putting in or community backlash for not putting in. and since there's multiples of that in the internet, i am not going to risk rich [karen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karen_(slang)) threats for putting it in anyways.
- i want to get the mash-up pack in official way so bad

## Why is this file existed? Explain like I'm 5.
- I found skins from Super Mario Mashup Pack were not cross-platform the hard way, I made bug reports for that, I upvoted [one "suggession" in Minecraft Feedback](https://feedback.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/community/posts/360021759332--Licensed-Content-Super-Mario-mashup), I begged Mojang for Super Mario Mash-up Pack in PC and mobile, Mojang said it was licensing issue and / or planned platform exclusivity, and claimed would be fixed "soon", i went too far and got myself muted / banned. I cannot contact Nintendo cuz it's unrelated to all of methods. So I called them out in fit of rage.
- i had discovered a workaround to the issue i am having, and created a bug report with the workaround as an workaround, in a fit of rage.
- For PC it's Microsoft Windows, for mobile it's iOS, iPadOS, Android and Fire.
- Did not include XBOX and PS because these are consoles from Nintendo's competitors.
  
### the beg was also about making Super Mario Mash-up Pack available to multiple platforms for following reasons (orders from common to ridiculous):
  - Super Mario Mash-up Pack's IP license / copyright was not on the thumbnail (but located in Settings>General), unlike current licensed contents in Minecraft Marketplace (this is the most obivious without any cracking, just buy a Nintendo Switch, the game and a licensed content from Minecraft Marketplace.)
  - I cannot search one on Minecraft Marketplace catalog even in search on Nintendo Switch.
  - [Nintendo could've added a way to redeem for a mash-up pack on their site for use on PC and mobile](https://feedback.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/community/posts/360021759332/comments/25465641914125)
  - Mojang and Nintendo could've added the mash-up pack separately in Minecraft Marketplace (on PC and mobile) so anyone who wants to use the mash-up pack outside Nintendo Switch should pay for one, and profits of the mash-up pack can go to Nintendo.
  - The physical game box of Minecraft for Nintendo Switch i got, did not claim that the Super Mario Mash-up Pack is platform-specific mash-up pack.
  - I accidentally discovered a workaround.
  - They could've kept the claim consistent if it was not "Licensing issue" (gate-keeping).
  - I did not find out it was platform-restricted until i tried to apply the skin in cross-platform multiplayer ~~and I found one against using Super Mario Mash-up Pack in other platforms on a FAQ~~ (that answer was removed in March 2024 in Minecraft Help without the game updating, but since mid May, [this has been fixed](https://help.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/articles/360034753992), though still, after i tried to use them in cross-platform multiplayer).
  - The physical game box on mine isn't changed yet, although the default version of the game on digital store no longer said that it included Super Mario Mash-up Pack, Deleuxe version and physical box of the game said so without adding any disclaimer (as if the Super Mario Mash-up Pack could be treated the same as other Marketplace contents), having to have players (including me) then purchase it to find that they forcefully set multiplayer from cross-platform, to platform-specific at best, or forcefully disable all multiplayer at worst.
  - ~~Recently, the answer about that was removed in Minecraft Help, which means users won't be properly informed that the mash-up pack was platform-restrictive in official (support) sites before purchase, which then required players of unexperienced to contact Minecraft Support, or those who didn't contact and fully rely on official sites could be misled that the mash-up pack could be used on cross-platform multiplayer.~~ [(The deception has been fixed, for those who researches before purchase)](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/WEB-6914)
    - overall their moves made the claim very unpromising.
   
### Proves of the issue that make me support in flavor of making Super Mario Mash-up Pack to multiple platforms:
  - The physical game card box does not have a disclaimer
  - ~~I did not find an answer for "could i play the mash-up pack on cross-platform multiplayer" in Minecraft Help (only one which is deceptive, on an article "Different Minecraft Editions" i've shown very below)~~
  - Platform restriction feature is broken with me finding a workaround to it and [people's discovery of it taking too far in Create World Screen](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-180557)
  - [Inconsistencies between the trailer and my experience, and even the video itself](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/WEB-7134)
   
### Since October 2023, i have contacted Minecraft Support (part of Minecraft Help) for issues with the mash-up pack and if they could put it up (with Nintendo) to Minecraft Marketplace (for PC and mobile players to enjoy) because of piracy issue and i had to download Super Mario Mash-up Pack from the internet when i wanted to use it on other officially-supported platform because there is no way to get it in Minecraft Marketplace on PC and mobile officially, and they claimed that mash-up pack is already a Marketplace content, even though i cannot search for one, and said they couldn't because it's 2 of the worst duo, licensing issue and (or) planned platform exclusivity. Until May 2024, over multiple attempts to ask / beg Minecraft to put the mash-up pack to multiple platforms, 3 of attempts resulted in Support staffs putting out reasons, with 2 of them being obviously "licensing issue" and the other one being planned platform exclusivity with no proper reasoning.

### i had also contacted local Nintendo by saying "i have a question, is with nintendo switch online. if i could play with players of other platforms with Minecraft: Deluxe Collection or just in Minecraft, can i be able to play Super Mario Mash-up Pack with players of other platforms or even using skins from Super Mario Mash-up Pack for playing worlds hosted from other-platform?", even though it's parent company is the licensee, they said "...We don't have any information about the game (Minecraft), consider contacting the developer of the game (Mojang)"

### UPDATE: in March and May, i tried contecting Minecraft Support again, with workarounds, one is that i got conviced after the FAQs were removed, and another is if the mash-up pack would be released in multiple platforms with the licensee in few weeks, with both "unable to confirm" (or "confirming that's not" in staff's speak), despite those in Minecraft Help no longer existing in early 2024. although the case's closed without banning in former attempt (because i did not say if i was screwed in that attempt), the lattter attempt resulted in me being ghosted again and an artificial ban after i asked if i was screwed if i had the game for other platforms and wanted the mash-up pack but without the Nintendo Switch. which i did not ever have rage speech, so it's an insanely immature take, because of that, i cannot also report any issue about toxic reviewer in Minecraft Feedback.

### The longer they gate-keep the mash-up pack from officially being usable on PC and mobile, the more mad i am.

## Wait, who made Super Mario Mash-up Pack?
- In my opinion, Mojang Studios, 4J Studios and Nintendo made the mash-up pack, with Nintendo licensing it.

## Hold up, RTX feature (such as Ray-tracing) is currently PC-exclusive, can you tell me some differences between it and the Super Mario Mash-up Pack? (as a Microsoft Windows PC user)
- Officially, and currently, Super Mario Mash-up Pack is the DLC / "Marketplace content" / mash-up pack currently included (bundled) only on Nintendo Switch, while ray-tracing is a feature that currently requires NVIDIA GeForce RTX or AMD Radeon RX 6000 or better to work.

- Currently, you can buy an NVIDIA GeForce RTX / AMD Radeon RX graphics card for your PC to play with official ray-tracing. But you cannot buy the official version of Super Mario Mash-up Pack or even download one to your PC, thus you need to download the unofficial one from the internet, the only legal way to use the Super Mario Mash-up Pack if you won't use PC is to buy a Nintendo hardware, and so the mash-up pack is easily forgettable (even though you were the fan of both games).

- Also, officially, although RTX-enabled worlds cannot be downloaded or be created on devices without ray-tracing hardware and support, players who don't have ray-tracing hardware and support (even mobile) can join players with ray-tracing hardware whose playing RTX-enabled worlds. However official version of Super Mario Mash-up Pack can't be created on PC or mobile because it's not available to Minecraft Marketplace for there in the first place, and on Nintendo Switch, it's resource pack also forcefully disables cross-platform multiplayer so it can only be joined by players on Nintendo Switches ~~, and it cannot be reverted even by deleting the one a world has cached with, so you cannot play with players that are on PC or even mobile~~ (Fixed since Release 1.21 for latest).

- players who play Minecraft Preview on mobile (iOS and Android), XBOX or PC, regardless having a ray-tracing hardware / support or not, can alternatively use Deferred Rendering (Ray-tracing-like custom shaders if put with ray-tracing enabled resource packs). But there's no official alternatives to playing Super Mario Mash-up Pack if even PC players or mobile players wants to, and community-made workarounds require intense and technical procedure and they will risk getting broken and/or defeated by an anti-feature from a DRM in future revisions or versions.

- TL;DR: Ray-tracing can only be used on PC with ray-tracing hardware but those who do not have one can join in other's ray-tracing-enabled world or in Minecraft Preview, use deferred rendering, while Super Mario Mash-up Pack can only be used on Nintendo Switch, forcefully disables cross-platform multiplayer, and has no official alternatives or workarounds.

BS question.~~ Replaced by a question about signing-in Microsoft Account to Nintendo Switch.

## Did Nintendo use Super Mario Mash-up Pack as a promotion for Minecraft (for Nintendo Switch) in 2023 and onwards?
- Yes, I found some Minecraft Promotion in Nintendo that used Super Mario Mash-up Pack, in 2023 to 2024, like
- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmYAKpGo-B0
- https://twitter.com/NintendoAmerica/status/1620527350344450050
- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TsDr9Qow94 ([most inconsistent with disclaimer at 0:51 being against a footage in 0:33 to 0:35](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/WEB-7134) [look at the top right of the video carefully])

## What is the workaround to the issue if users wanted to play cross-platform with skins from Super Mario Mash-up Pack anyways?
- A vague explanation of my workaround can be found [here](https://feedback.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/community/posts/360021759332/comments/23409371173773) , please note that it will be defeated and become ineffective in the future update, if so, i will update it to prove it defeated. Even though i intended the discovery to be so you could play with friends in your or friend's world (not Realms or featured server) in the skin. As stated, this workaround only applies to skins. I wished the Super Mario Mash-up Pack was made to Minecraft (Marketplace) for PC and mobile for people that like to use PC or mobile so they can enjoy these without having to do the workaround.

## What is the current solution to the issue if Mojang and Nintendo did not put the mash-up pack to multiple platforms?
- People said <a href="https://www.planetminecraft.com/resources/?keywords=mario">using custom skins from the internet with mobile and PC as a solution</a>, but little did they know, if they were playing the game on PC, with an extra app to import the skin-pack, and some seriousness, they can also download the mash-up pack from the same internet and have enjoyed these on PC that was only used for Nintendo Switch players according to the BS.

- our reasonings are two of proofs why no one gave a damn even though the mash-up pack is not available to be purchased in PC or mobile in the first place. these are Nintendo and Mojang's service (skill) issues. Should Nintendo and Mojang wake-up and put the mash-up pack to Minecraft (Marketplace) on PC and mobile, with no platform restrictions, so people can then get the mash-up pack on platforms people want in easier way?
